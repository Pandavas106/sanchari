# Firebase Setup Guide for Shared Trips & Community Features

## Current Issue
The error "Missing or insufficient permissions" occurs because Firebase Firestore security rules don't allow access to the `sharedTrips` collection and related community features.

## Solution

### Option 1: Deploy Firebase Rules (Recommended)
1. Install Firebase CLI if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. Replace the contents of `firestore.rules` with the comprehensive rules provided in the project root.

5. Deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Rules Update
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `sanchari-d123c`
3. Navigate to `Firestore Database` ‚Üí `Rules`
4. Replace the existing rules with the content from `firestore.rules`
5. Click "Publish"

### Option 3: Demo Mode (Current Implementation)

- View sample shared trips
- Test the UI and functionality

## Security Model:

### **Public Access:**
```javascript

match /sharedTrips/{tripId} {
  allow read: if true;
}
```

### **Creator Control:**
```javascript
// Only creators can modify their trips
allow update: if request.auth != null && 
             request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId;
```

### **User Privacy:**
```javascript
// Users control their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### **Community Engagement:**
```javascript
// Users can comment and rate
match /tripComments/{commentId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
               request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
}
```

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy the Firebase rules using Option 1 or 2 above
2. Run the DataSeeder to populate real shared trips data
